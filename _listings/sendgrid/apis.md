    **This endpoint allows you to retrieve the statistics for your Parse Webhook useage.**

    SendGrid's Inbound Parse Webhook allows you to parse the contents and attachments of incomming emails. The Parse API can then POST the parsed emails to a URL that you specify. The Inbound Parse Webhook cannot parse messages greater than 20MB in size, including all attachments.

    There are a number of pre-made integrations for the SendGrid Parse Webhook which make processing events easy. You can find these integrations in the [Library Index](https://sendgrid.com/docs/Integrate/libraries.html#-Webhook-Libraries).
