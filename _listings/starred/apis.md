description: 'Better feedback for everyone, on a human scale. At Starred we like to
  work smart: working smarter to build great software, and working with smart companies
  who listen. As the feedback solution which puts the respondent first, we&rsquo;re
  empowering conversations between companies and their customers and employees. What&rsquo;s
  more, we equip them with the actionable insights they need to make better decisions
  and boost loyalty. With leading lights like Deliveroo, Heineken and Spotify already
  working with us to bring feedback to life, the road ahead for better feedback is
  looking good.'
